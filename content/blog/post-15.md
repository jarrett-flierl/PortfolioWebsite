# Jarrett Christian Flierl Drinks Kiff Kafe Coffee

### Kiff* = French slang for a small but potent pleasure

<hr>
What is coffee to you? To me, coffee intake is a daily ritual boosting my temple’s performance. Whether placing an order at a coffee shop while setting up my “workspace” or bringing my tea kettle to boil from the comfort of home, my morning revolves around COFFEE.

Today, I popped into KIFF KAFE to see how this West LA coffee shop sizes up to the competition! Located just off the 10 in WestLA’s Sawtelle neighborhood, KIFF KAFE is somewhat of a hidden gem to me. After traveling by the friendly blue creatures muralized on its building for the past 14 months, today was the day I would finally check it out. 

Today’s coffee choice: house drip, black (above average)

Today’s lite breakfast: ham & cheese croissant w/ cornichons (delicious)

Chilly Santa Monica mornings usually lead to a nice cup of HOT coffee rather than the iced or cold brew coffee I enjoy in warmer climates (Florida Man), so we went with two black as night, hot as hell, house drip coffee with a ham & cheese croissant on the side. 

Quickly scored a spot at the “big table” in the not so empty, somewhat busy, inside seating area directly in front of the registers. Just before I heard the start-up chime (duuunnnNNNnnn) on my brand new 2019 16” Macbook Pro, an employee with two large white ceramic mugs / matching saucers were at the table. Service was friendly/speedy and the food and beverage was GREAT!
*For those of you that don’t speak NERD, I mentioned my laptop because its extremely FAST and boots up in seconds((duuunnnNNNnnn) ;) 
** if you still don’t understand the reference, THE COFFEE CAME FAST ;) ;)

Depending on your workspace needs Kiff Kafe offers a variety of seating options from dining for 1 to larger group/gear tables spread throughout the indoor/outdoor space. WIFI was available however, after running several speed tests, the results were garbage. 1.4mb downloads, sub 1mb uploads kind of garbage! Nerds like myself will be happy to know that the 4G LTE signal in the area was spectacular and I was able to get my bandwidth heavy work finished with a mobile hotspot. If you’re just using the wifi to read/send emails, you’ll be fine, but heavier reliance (i.e. working remote via a cloud database system) will require you to carry WIFI with you. I gotta say a place that looks like this while also providing tons of seating and charging areas is hard to find in LA. The Art/Deco side of the coffee house business is often placed above things such as guest comfort and access to power, Kiff Kafe is the best of both! 

So, whether you’re looking to post up and work remote for a few hours, or meet-up with a friend/colleague/date, Kiff Kafe definitely is a great option.
