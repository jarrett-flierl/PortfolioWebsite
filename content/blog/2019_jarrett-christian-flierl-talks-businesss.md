# Let's get to business!
### By Jarrett Christian Flierl


<hr>


##### Paragraph

Super excited to start posting to this business category more! Business has been my "major" since my first thrift store. I was 6 and would hunt the neighborhoods garage sales for rare finds to then re-sell them for profit. Later that grew into buying garage sale items and putting them on e-bay..

Here I will be discussing how i've continued to make money online over the years, and how I stay on top of new trends in the ever growing online world.
